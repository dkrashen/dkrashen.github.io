		<p><b>Field patching</b> is a technique for working with algebraic
		structures over fields of transcendence degree 1 over complete
		discretely valued fields, such as <b>Q</b><sub>p</sub>(t).  Over
		the past few years, I have been working with David Harbater and
		Julia Hartmann on developing this theory in order to answer
		questions about division algebras, quadratic forms, Galois
		cohomology and torsors for linear algebraic groups over such
		fields. These techniques also give rise to a number of new
		local-global principles for algebraic structures over these
		fields.</p>

		<p><b>The complexity of algebraic structures and its relation to
		field arithmetic</b> has been major theme in my recent research.
		Algebraic structures such as central simple algebras and quadratic
		forms give rise to a number of important arithmetic invariants of a
		field, such as its Brauer dimension and its <i>u</i>-invariant.
		These invariants are related to each other as well as to the
		field's Diophantine dimension, cohomological dimension, and symbol
		length bounds for Galois cohomology. Many fundmental problems in
		field arithmetic involve understanding these invariants and their
		relationship to each other, and there are many more invariants
		defined via algebra and algebraic geometry which promise to hold
		very rich and subtle information about field arithmetic.</p>
