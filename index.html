      <p style="margin-left: 15px">I am an associate professor of
      mathematics at the University of Georgia, Athens. My research is
      currently supported by an NSF CAREER grant "The Arithmetic of Fields
      and the Complexity of Algebraic Structures," for which I was awarded
      a Presendential Early Career Award (PECASE). My research is also
      support by NSF FRG grant "Obstructions to Local-Global Principles and
      Applications to Algebraic Structures," and I am a co-PI on the UGA
      RTG grant "Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Number Theory." I have
      been awarded the University of Georgia Creative Research Medal, and
      the University of Georgia Outstanding Professor Award.</p>
