    <p style="margin-left: 15px">I am an associate professor of mathematics
    at the University of Georgia, Athens. My research is currently
    supported by an NSF CAREER grant "The Arithmetic of Fields and the
    Complexity of Algebraic Structures," for which I was awarded a
    Presendential Early Career Award (PECASE). My research is also support
    by NSF FRG grant "Obstructions to Local-Global Principles and
    Applications to Algebraic Structures," and I am a co-PI on the UGA RTG
    grant "Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Number Theory." I have been
    awarded the University of Georgia Creative Research Medal, and the
    University of Georgia Outstanding Professor Award.</p>

		<h3>Research interests</h3> 
    <p>Finite dimensional division algebras and the Brauer group, linear
    algebraic groups, algebraic cycles, and field theory.</p>
    <p>I am particularly interested in the use of techniques and ideas from
    algebraic topology and algebraic geometry to problems in algebra.</p>

    <h4>The LAAST Seminar</h4>

    The Late Afternoon Algebraic Structures Tea is an informal
    seminar/meeting to discuss current topics in Algebra, Algebraic
    Geometry, or General Nonsense. Sign up below to make sure to be
    notified when a meeting is announced!

    <h4>Don't miss a coffee hour!</h4>

    Coffee hours are an opportunity for informal meetings to talk about
    classes, majors, 
    mathematics, and other things. They are open to my students and
    advisees, and whoever happens to be in the matrix at the time! Lattes
    and snacks are generally featured.
