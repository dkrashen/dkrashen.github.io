We'll be having coffee hour again tomorrow, Friday March 18. Please stop by the Matrix (Boyd 308) between 11:00 and 12:00 (not the same time as before).

Coffee hours are open to my students and advisees, and basically whoever happens to be around in the Matrix. If you are interested in receiving notifications when there is an upcoming coffee hour, you can use these [ifttt](http://ifttt.com) recipes for either email or device notifications:
