Tomorrow at 2:30 we'll be meeting again for the LAAST seminar, and this
time I'll actually give a talk:

<b>Clifford algebras and the search for Ulrich bundles</b>

<i>The classical notion of the Clifford algebra of a quadratic form has been
generalized to other types of higher degree forms by a number of authors.
The representations of these generalized Clifford algebras turn out to
correspond to “Ulrich bundles,” which are a very special class of vector
bundle on a hypersurface. </i>

<i>In this talk, I’ll describe joint work with Adam Chapman and Max
Lieblich, of a new construction, generalizing the previous ones, of a
Clifford algebra of a finite morphism of proper schemes, I'll discuss
connections to the arithmetic of genus 1 curves, and I'll present some new
results on the existence of Ulrich bundles.</i>

Hope to see everyone there!
