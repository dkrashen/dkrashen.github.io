Things are moving forward nicely with the upcoming Brauer group conference, which will run 8-12 June, 2015.
It looks like we will have a really great bunch of participants this year. Thanks to additional funding from the NSF which has been approved, along with funds from my CAREER grant, we should be able to support the travel costs of many of our participants. Please stay tuned for new information on reimbursement forms!
