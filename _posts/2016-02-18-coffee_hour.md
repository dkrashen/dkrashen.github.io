I'll be holding my first coffee hour of the semester tomorrow, Friday February 19. Please stop by the matrix (Boyd 308) between 12:45 and 1:45. I'll bring some snacks and my latte machine, and will serve as many soy lattes, matcha lattes, and espressos as needed until supplies run out!

The coffee hour is an open forum for my students and advisees to meet each other and discuss school, courses, and mathematics. Hope to see you all there!
