This summer once again Angela Gibney and myself will be running the [UGA
SummerMathcamp][mathcamp]! Registration is now open.

We are interested, as always, in reaching out to get our local deparmental
community involved in our activities, and are looking for:

- **Math department faculty** can participate by organizing and overseeing group activities. Each faculty member will be responsible for roughly 5 high school students. Funding is available for bringing in great speakers who will help raise interested among either our campers, or our undergraduates.
- **Math department gradaute students** can help out as group leaders, working with teams of roughly 5 high school students, coordinating activities with the faculty members, and meeting with the team daily. We are also looking for one or two graduate students to help with camp administration. Some funding for graduate students will be available to support costs of books and materials for their research.
- **Undergraduate math majors** can be group helpers, meeting daily with their assigned high school student teams. Undergraduates will be paid an hourly wage for their participation.
