      <p >I am a Presidential Professor of
      Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania.

      My research generally concerns algebra and arithmetic geometry, in particular, the interactions between
      field arithmetic, algebraic objects such as division algebras and quadratic forms,
      and arithmetic and algebraic geometry.
      In 2016, I was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award (PECASE) for my research by
      President Barack Obama.

      I am a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, and on the
      editorial board of the American Mathematical Monthly.

      Previously I was a professor of mathematics at Rutgers University and before that,
      at the University of Georgia.
      I was awarded the UGA Creative Research Medal in 2013, and
      the UGA Outstanding Professor Award in 2016.

      <p><b>Research Interests:</b></p><p> Finite dimensional division algebras and the Brauer group, linear algebraic groups, algebraic
      cycles, and field theory.</p>
      <p>I am particularly interested in the application of techniques and ideas from algebraic topology and
      algebraic geometry to problems in algebra.</p>
