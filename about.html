      <p style="margin-left: 15px">I am a professor of
      mathematics at Rutgers University. My research currently supported by an NSF CAREER grant "The Arithmetic of Fields
      and the Complexity of Algebraic Structures," for which I was awarded
      a Presidential Early Career Award (PECASE)
      as well as by the NSF FRG grant "Obstructions to Local-Global Principles and
      Applications to Algebraic Structures."

      While at the University of Georgia, I was
      awarded the UGA Creative Research Medal,
      the UGA Outstanding Professor Award.

      I am a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, and on the
      editorial board of the American Mathematical Monthly as well as the
      Notices of the American Mathematical Society.

      <p><b>Research Interests:</b></p><p> Finite dimensional division algebras and the Brauer group, linear algebraic groups, algebraic
      cycles, and field theory.</p>
      <p>I am particularly interested in the use of techniques and ideas from algebraic topology and
      algebraic geometry to problems in algebra.</p>
