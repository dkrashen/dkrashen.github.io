    title: "Birational isomorphisms between noncommutative surfaces, finite over their centers"
    venue: "Special Algebraic Geometry Seminar, UT Austin"
    year: 2014
    abstract: "Just as there are many interpretations of a ``noncommutative
    space'' in the context of algebraic geometry, there are also many ways
    of comparing such spaces and many ways in which they can be considered
    equivalent. In this talk we will be concerned with the notion of
    birational isomorphisms between noncommutative projective schemes, and
    in particular, between quantum planes which are finite over their
    centers. To do this we will introduce algebr-geometric/combinatorial
    methods for working with these objects and producing noncommutative
    birational invariants. This will allow us to distinguish between
    certain birational equivalence class of quantum planes, answering a
    question of Izuru Mori."
