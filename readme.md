my plans:

for the research list, will use a dictionary, with each item inside a small
well. the code will have a nest something like this:
<dl>
  <div class="well well-sm">
  <dt>paper title</dt>
  <dd>coauthors, information, etc</dd>
  </div>
</dl>

could also add buttons on the right. perhaps something like this:
<dl>
  <div class="well well-sm">
  <dt>paper title</dt>
  <dd>coauthors, information, etc</dd>
  </div>
</dl>
